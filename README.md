# What Is This Project For? 

This is an ongoing project using React JS, as part of a Solo Project in Scrimba's Frontend Developer Career Path.

The goal of the project is to gain some experience and practice using React JS instead of vanilla JS to develop the front end, thus this project will not be super complicated or convoluted


# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
